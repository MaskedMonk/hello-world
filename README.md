Hello-Wolrd Tutorial


Hi, 
My name is Johan. Becoming a Software Developer, is one of my goals.
Learning to Code is my dream. I started my journey with Swaroop's "A Byte of Python",
Due to various factors, I was dissueded from completing my Coding Introduction with Python.
Instead, I became persuaded to study C#. Currently I am working through: Svetlin Nakov & Co's:
"Fundamentals of Computer Programming with C#".
So far I am enjoying the experience, although I will not forget Python.
